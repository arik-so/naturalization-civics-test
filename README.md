# naturalization-civics-test

On November 13th 2020, USCIS [announced](https://www.uscis.gov/news/news-releases/uscis-announces-a-revised-naturalization-civics-test) 
a revised naturalization civics test. 
That test goes into effect for all applications submitted after December 1st 2020, and has an updated
[set of questions](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/2020test).

This repository preserves for posterity both the list of [old questions](naturalization_civics_test_2008.md), as well as the set of [new questions](naturalization_civics_test_2020.md).

## Differences

Additionally, I have compiled a [list of differences](naturalization_civics_test_delta.md) between the old questions and the new.

The number of total questions has grown from 100 to 128, but there are more than just 28 new questions.
Some old questions have been discarded.

In the [list of differences](naturalization_civics_test_delta.md), discarded questions are not shown.

Completely novel questions are highlighted in __bold__.

Questions that have been rephrased have the deprecated phrasing in ~~strikethrough~~.

Additionally, some questions have been rephrased in common patterns, which are noted in _(italic parentheses)_. 
Concretely, there are two common patterns:

- _(inversion)_ Where what used to be part of the question is now part of the expcected answer, and vice versa.
- _(expansion)_ A question that asked for _n_ elements in an answer now seeks _n+1_ or more.

All questions preserve their numbering from the [updated set](naturalization_civics_test_2020.md).
